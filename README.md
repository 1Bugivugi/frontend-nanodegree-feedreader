## Project Overview

The Udacity overview for this project states: "In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in."


## Instructions

To run the feed reader tests, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the test that you would like to perform. You can also choose to run all tests at once.

## Usage

You can either clone this repository to your local machine with $git clone https://github.com/1Bugivugi/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git or you can open it directly in your browser clicking this link - https://1bugivugi.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/

## Future Updates

I'm planning to upgrade this project when I'll finish the Nanodegree, so keep an eye on it ;)

## External Code Used in this Project

The starter code for this project was provided by Udacity.
I also coded along to Mohamed Riaad's Study Jam[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut_L8YUImbw&feature=youtu.be&t=1]

## Credits

The Study Jam by Mohamed Riaad helped me to get a basic understanding of the feed reader project. Also thanks to a team of students that I'm in touch with and Turtle Squad on slack channel :)
